With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway.
Crack! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean. Javert sees the and points his stick at Valjean in a silent command. Valjeans stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.

Now Prisoner 24601
Your time is up
And your parole’s begun.
You know what that means?

Yes. It means I’m free.

No! It means you get 
Your yellow ticket-of-leave.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.

This badge of shame
You’ll show it everywhere. 
It warns you’re a dangerous man.

I stole a loaf of bread
My sister’s child was close to death
And we were starving.

You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law.

I know the meaning of those nineteen years
A slave of the law!


Five years for what you did,
The rest because you tried to run.
Yes, 24601

My name is Jean Valjean!

And I’m Javert!
Do not forget my name.
Do not forget me 24601

He stries away to command the lines of convicts as they’re marched away.
Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last.

The convicts sing as he goes.

Look down, look down
You’ll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You’re standing in your grave.
